Starbucks pulls out of Israel, ends joint-venture.
Starbucks Coffee Co. has closed its six stores in Israel and ended its partnership with the Israeli company that ran the coffeehouses. But the pullout - which Starbucks said was due to ongoing operational challenges in the market does not represent a major setback for the company's worldwide expansion plans, analysts said. The stores, all in Tel Aviv, closed to customers, but would be wrapping up business through the end of the week, the company said. Starbucks would not disclose any detailed reasons for dissolving its partnership with the Delek Group of Israel.
